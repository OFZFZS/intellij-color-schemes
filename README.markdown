# What is this ?

A bunch of color schemes for the [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) python IDE. 
These schemes were not created by me, I merely ported them, because I wasn't happy with 
what I found online.

Here is the current list:

* Zen and Art, taken from https://github.com/irfn/zen-and-art
* Solarized Light, taken from http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized



# Installation

The XML files should be copied to the following directory:

* OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm10/colors/` 
* Linux: `~/.PyCharm10/config/color`
* Windows Vista (maybe Win7): `C:\Users\$USER\.PyCharm10\config\colors`
* Windows XP: `C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\.PyCharm10\config\colors`
